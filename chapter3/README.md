# Chapter 3: Control Flow

This chapter covers the control flow statements in C, which determine the order in which program statements are executed.

## Topics Covered
- Statements and Blocks
- If-Else
- Else-If
- Switch
- Loops and While
- For
- Do-While
- Break and Continue
- Goto and Labels

## Exercises
1. Our binary search makes two tests inside the loop, when one would suffice and the test inside the loop is expensive. Write a version with only one test inside the loop and measure the difference in run-time.
2. Write a function escape(s, t) that converts characters like newline and tab into visible escape sequences like \\n and \\t as it copies the string t to s. Use a switch. Write a function for the other direction as well, converting escape sequences into the real characters.
3. Write a function expand(s1, s2) that expands shorthand notations like a-z in the string s1 into the equivalent complete list abc...xyz in s2. Allow for letters of either case and digits, and be prepared to handle cases like a-b-c and a-z0-9 and -a-z. Arrange that a leading or trailing - is taken literally.
4. In a two's complement number representation, our version of itoa does not handle the largest negative number, that is, the value of n equal to -(2^(wordsize-1)). Explain why not. Modify it to print that value correctly, regardless of the machine on which it runs.
5. Write the function itob(n, s, b) that converts the integer n into a base b character representation in the string s. In particular, itob(n, s, 16) formats n as a hexadecimal integer in s.
6. Write a version of itoa that accepts three arguments instead of two. The third argument is a minimum field width; the converted number must be padded with blanks on the left if necessary to make it wide enough.
7. Write a function reverse(s) that reverses the character string s
8. Write a function expand(s1,s2) that expands shorthand notations like a-z in the string s1 into the equivalent complete list abc...xyz in s2
9. In a two's complement number representation, our version of itoa does not handle the largest negative number. Modify it to print that value correctly
10. Write the function itob(n,s,b) that converts the integer n into a base b character representation in the string s
